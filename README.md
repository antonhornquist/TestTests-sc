# TestTests-sc

Unit tests for the unit test framework for SuperCollider (!)

## Requirements

Requires Test-sc classes.

These classes were developed and have been tested in SuperCollider 3.6.6.

## Installation

Install the [Test-sc](http://github.com/antonhornquist/Test-sc) dependency.

Copy the `TestTests-sc` folder to the user-specific or system-wide extension directory. Recompile the SuperCollider class library.

The user-specific extension directory may be retrieved by evaluating `Platform.userExtensionDir` in SuperCollider, the system-wide by evaluating `Platform.systemExtensionDir`.
